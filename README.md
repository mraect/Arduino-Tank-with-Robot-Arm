# Arduino Tank with Robot Arm 

![ArduTankRobotArm](https://github.com/mraect/[reponame]/blob/[branch]/image.jpg?raw=true)

> For finished product photos, look "Imgs" folder.

# Needed Files;
  - For Robot Arm 3D files grab it from [Thingiverse - RobotArm3D][thingArm]
  - For Tank Threads 3D files grab it from [Thingiverse - Tank3D][thingTank]
  - For adapters and new chassis look "STL" folder
  - Code file look "Codes" folder
  - Need some sort of remote controller or raw Arduino attached nRF24L01 and some pots
  
  ### Folder Structure

	| Folder | Description |
	| ------ | ------ |
	| Codes | Has 2 ino folder. One is for Main Arduino (KumandaAliciBasit) and other is for Robot Arm (RobotKolTekData)|
	| Docs | PDF file which contains wiring diagram and explains data connection |
	| Imgs | Images from finished project. Wiring photos, finished photos etc. |
	| STL | 3D printer files which needed to make this project done |

  
# Needed Parts;
  - 2x Arduino Pro Mini
  - 4x DC geared Arduino motor
  - 5x 9g Servo (metal gear preferred)
  - 2x nRF24L01+ with breakout board
  - 3D printed files
  - Matek PDB or 12V to 5V buck converter (and more jumper wire)
  - M3 and M4 screws and nuts
  - 2mm x 30mm nails for treads
  - 2x Brushed ESC for tracks or one Brushed ESC which can control 2 motors separately.
  - 2S or 3S LiPo battery or 2 or 3 18650 LiIon battery
  - Jumper wires (female-female) to many of them :D

# Needed Tools;
  - Arduino IDE (v1.8.9 or higher) installed PC
  - 3D printer or slicing program fot STL files (Slic3r, Simple3D software etc.)
  - Screw driver
  - If you use PDB, need soldering iron
